
--Game Folder Prep

Copy the contents of GameFolder to your 64bit game folder

-Windows 10â€™s Creators Update and Newer Only

Just run MakeDebugJunction.bat

-Older Windows 10 and Other Windows

You need to run MakeDebugJunction.bat as admin from the 64bit game folder.
Good Luck!




--Debug Symbol Building

PDBs dont work with Mono, you need an MDB.

'pdb2mdb.exe' is in the folder, and is needed to convert a PDB to MDB.
Run it like "pdb2mdb.exe plugin_pacas00.CPHPatcher.dll" as part of your build process.

I generally use this in a post build for one of my unreleased nightmares.


pdb2mdb.exe plugin_pacas00.CPHPatcher.dll
copy plugin_pacas00.CPHPatcher.dll "C:\Users\Peter\AppData\Local\ProjectorGames\FortressCraft\Mods\pacas00.CPHPatcher\1" /Y
copy plugin_pacas00.CPHPatcher.pdb "C:\Users\Peter\AppData\Local\ProjectorGames\FortressCraft\Mods\pacas00.CPHPatcher\1" /Y
copy plugin_pacas00.CPHPatcher.dll.mdb "C:\Users\Peter\AppData\Local\ProjectorGames\FortressCraft\Mods\pacas00.CPHPatcher\1" /Y



--Updating the Unity Player debug binaries.

Did DJ Update? Are you trying to use this on any other unity game? 
Your gonna need to find the right Unity binaries. Files listed here-on will differ between Unity versions.
Right now DJ uses Unity 5.6.5f1, Any other Unity game may differ.

Currently, Unity stores it's player binaries for the windows standalone player in, by default,

C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor\Data\PlaybackEngines\windowsstandalonesupport\Variations

For Win64 with mono, use win64_development_mono

Generally, i only copy player_win.exe and player_win_development_x64.pdb.
Which you need to rename to FC_64_debug.exe and FC_64_debug.pdb respectively.
